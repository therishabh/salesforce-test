# Test Class

## Introduction

In Salesforce, a test class is used to test the functionality of Apex classes and triggers. The purpose of writing a test class is to ensure that your code works as expected and that it meets the requirements of your business logic.

Test classes help you to catch errors before they occur in production, so it is crucial to write good test classes.

- It's important to note that Salesforce requires a minimum of 75% code coverage for all Apex classes and triggers.
- This means that at least 75% of the lines of code in your classes and triggers must be covered by test methods.

## Benefits of Test Classes in Salesforce

- **Ensuring code quality:** Test classes help to ensure that your code works as intended and meets the requirements of your business logic.
- **Catching errors early:** Test classes help to catch errors early in the development process before they reach production. This saves time and reduces the risk of costly errors that can impact business processes.
- **Meeting code coverage requirements:** Test classes are required in Salesforce to meet code coverage requirements.
- **Facilitating collaboration:** Test classes can help facilitate collaboration between developers and QA teams.
- **Facilitating code maintenance:** Test classes can help with code maintenance by providing a way to test changes made to existing code.

In summary, test classes are an essential part of the development process in Salesforce. They help to ensure code quality, catch errors early, meet code coverage requirements, facilitate collaboration, and facilitate code maintenance.
